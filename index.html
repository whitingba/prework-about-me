      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been working in the mortgage industry since 2003 in multiple facets of that industry. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I moved to Colorado in 1997 from Michigan, where I lived for about 11 years. Prior to that I lived in Florida, which is where the majority of my family lives today.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Love to read, hike, walk my dog, garden and spend time with my family. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Not entirely sure, but I would love to put the knowledge I learn in this class to build onto my career in the mortgage industry maybe building tools to make other's lives easier.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Centennial, CO with my husband and our 15 year old son who is just finishing his freshman year of high school. We have a dog named Friday and a cat named Wednesday. I have lived in Colorado since 1997 and love all that Colorado has to offer us.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In the past 16 years in the mortgage industry I have held 6 different positions spread across only two companies in that time period. I like to be challenged so I have renewed energy when I go to work. I have hit the point in my career where I need a need a change and there are limited roles left available to me. I am looking for something new to wake up my brain and keep me challenged into retirement.</p>
