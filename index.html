      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I live with my husband and our 15 year old son who is finishing his freshman year of high school. We have a dog named Friday and a car named Wednesday. I have lived in Colorado since 1997 and love all that Colorado has to offer us. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I moved to Colorado in 1997 from Michigan, where I lived for about 11 years. Prior to that I lived in Florida, which is where the majority of my family lives.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Love to read, hike, walk my dog, garden and spend time with my family. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Not entirely sure, but I am hoping this class will help me find it.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In Centennial, Colorado with my family.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been in my current industry for the past almost 16 years and I am no longer challenged. I am looking for something new to wake up my brain and keep me challenged into retirement.</p>
